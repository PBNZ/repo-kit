# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security issues through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository:

- **Report a vulnerability:** https://github.com/PBNZ/repo-kit/security/advisories/new

This channel is private, visible only to the maintainers and to GitHub's security infrastructure.

## What to include

When reporting, please include as much of the following as you can:

- A clear description of the issue and its potential impact.
- The affected component (for example, `plugins/repokit/skills/new-repo`, a bundled template, or a validation script).
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept.
- Any suggested mitigation or fix, if you have one.

## What to expect

- An initial acknowledgement as soon as the maintainer sees the report.
- A follow-up with an assessment and a plan (accept, mitigate, or decline) once triage is complete.
- Public disclosure, if any, coordinated with the reporter after a fix or mitigation is available.

## Scope

This policy covers the contents of this repository — the marketplace manifest, the `repokit` plugin, its skills (`new-repo`, `repo-standard`), and the bundled templates and scripts. It does not cover:

- The Claude Code CLI, Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, the Claude API, or any other first-party Anthropic product. Please report those through Anthropic's own security channels.
- Repositories scaffolded *by* RepoKit. Once scaffolded, a repo is its own project — report issues there.

## Safe harbour

Good-faith security research on this repository — including reproduction of the issue on your own fork or test account — will not be pursued or treated as a violation of this project's terms, provided you:

- Avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, or disruption to other users.
- Do not exfiltrate any data beyond the minimum necessary to demonstrate the issue.
- Give the maintainers a reasonable opportunity to resolve the issue before any public disclosure.
